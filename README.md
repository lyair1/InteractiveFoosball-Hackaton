# InteractiveFoosball-Hackaton
Interactive Foosball project for the 2016 Microsoft Hackaton


Prepare your environment:

1. Download OpenCV(2.4.13): http://opencv.org/downloads.html
2. Install OpenCV and set up the environment variables: OPENCV_DIR <OpenCV_DIR>\Build\x86\vc12
3. Add "OPENCV_DIR <OPENCV_DIR>\Build\x86\vc12\bin" to your User and System Environment variables
4. Compile and run the project, you should see the demo video running (you might need to change the path to the file... you will see where)
